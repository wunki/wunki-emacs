;; to install the `lolcode-mode' package. We'd also declare one or more
;; entry points so the module isn't loaded unneccesarily at startup.
;; For instance, `(use-package my-module :commands (my-function))' will
;; defer loading `my-module' until you actually call `(my-function)'.

;; Read about it in detail at https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package

;; First, we make sure it's installed, using a function provided by
;; Paradox, which we've just installed the hard way.

;; instead of expecting you to do it manually.
